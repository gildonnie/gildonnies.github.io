                <h1 class="display-1">Katana</h1>
                <p>A katana (刀 or かたな or カタナ) is a Japanese sword characterized by a curved, single-edged blade with
                    a
                    circular or squared guard and long grip to accommodate two hands.
                    Developed later than the tachi, it was used by samurai in feudal Japan and worn with the edge
                    facing
                    upward. Since the Muromachi period, many old tachi were cut from the
                    root and shortened, and the blade at the root was crushed and converted into katana.
                    The official term for katana in Japan is uchigatana and the term katana often refers to
                    single-edged
                    swords from around the world</p>

                    <p>Katanas were used as weapons for the military warriors which became known as samurais. The katana
                        was
                        such a crucial part of a samurai's life that when a young warrior was on the verge of entering
                        this
                        world, the sword he would use as a protector was brought into the delivery room as if to greet
                        the
                        young
                        one. And, when a weathered, old veteran warrior was on his deathbed, ready to cross over into
                        the
                        White
                        Jade Pavilion of the afterlife, his katana was placed at his side, as if to protect him one last
                        time.
