                    <p class="text-fira fs-5 lh-lg fw-light">A katana is a Japanese sword characterized by a curved,
                        single-edged blade with a
                        circular or squared guard and long grip to accommodate two hands.
                        Developed later than the tachi, it was used by samurai in feudal Japan and worn with the edge
                        facing
                        upward. Since the Muromachi period, many old tachi were cut from the
                        root and shortened, and the blade at the root was crushed and converted into katana.
                        The official term for katana in Japan is uchigatana and the term katana often refers to
                        single-edged
                        swords from around the world</p>

                    as samurais. The katana
                    was
                    such a crucial part of a samurai's life that when a young warrior was on the verge of entering
                    this
                    world, the sword he would use as a protector was brought into the delivery room as if to greet
                    the
                    young
                    one. And, when a weathered, old veteran warrior was on his deathbed, ready to cross over into
                    the
                    White
                    Jade Pavilion of the afterlife, his katana was placed at his side, as if to protect him one last
                    time.
